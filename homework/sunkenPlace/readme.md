# The Sunken Place

This project is an interactive TV. By clicking on the different arrows of the remote, you can find a selection of movies to watch along with a summary of each and what awards it has won.

For: Young Adults
Idea: Itâ€™s a dark tv screening room that displays a broken TV. The TV will have a glitch that goes in between shows/movies with the same kind of vibe as Get Out. It will display the name of the show and a description on the screen.
Where: It will be displayed online.
When: At the end of the year, since it will show the best shows/movies of the year.
