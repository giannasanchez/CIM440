# The Sunken Place

This project is an interactive TV. By clicking (with a sound) on the different arrows of the remote, you can find a selection of movies to watch along with a summary of each and what awards it has won. The project is for young adults and will be displayed online. At the end of the year, it will continue to add new movies.
